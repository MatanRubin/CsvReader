# Matlab CSV Reader
Working with CSV files in Matlab is a PITA. This utility class helps do that
by providing the following functionality:

* Read CSV files with both numeric and string data
* Get a column by a numeric index or an Excel like index
* Get column title by a numeric index or an Excel like index
* Create variables in the workspace using a numeric index or an Excel like index

It also detects the data types by itself, so no conversions are necessary.

Disclaimer: This code was written as a helper class for another project, and was
never meant to serve as a bullet proof general purpose utility, so use at your
own risk.

## Usage Examples
TODO

## Notes
1. Tested with Matlab 2013 on a Mac.
2. Doesn't support Windows environments (but should be easy to add if needed).
